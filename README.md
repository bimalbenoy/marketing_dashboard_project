# ðŸ“Š Marketing Dashboard Project

This project is a **Marketing Intelligence Dashboard** built with **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Plotly**.
It helps marketers and business teams understand how their ad spend connects to revenue, customers, and efficiency metrics.

## ðŸš€ What does it do?

- Cleans raw marketing + business CSV files (Facebook, Google, TikTok, Business data).
- Aggregates them into daily totals, channel summaries, campaign summaries, and state-level performance.
- Computes key metrics like **ROAS, CAC, AOV, CTR, CPC, CPM, Margin ROAS**.
- Provides an **interactive dashboard** with filters (date, channel, state, campaign search).
- Shows easy-to-understand insights with explanations (not just numbers).
- Exports results and charts as CSV/PNG for reports.
